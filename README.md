This project involves using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to analyze LiDAR data, which is collected by sensors that measure distances to objects. The data is structured as sequences, where each sequence contains multiple time steps and features. The model is built using LSTM layers, which are good at remembering information over time.

The model is then trained on this data to learn patterns. After training, the model can make predictions on new LiDAR data. This approach can be useful in applications like self-driving cars or robotics.
